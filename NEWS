1.12.0-2
  - Vendor rust code as requested by CRAN
  - CRAN request: use role="aut" for rust dependencies
  - CRAN request: use -j2 instead of CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2

1.12.0-1
  - Windows: add -lntdll linker flag required by Rust 1.70

1.12.0
  - Update embedded libgifski to upstream 1.12.0
  - Windows: if Cargo is available, default to source build of libgifski

1.6.6-1
  - Fix for legacy Windows Vista/2008 (for the old winbuilder)

1.6.6
  - Update vendored gifski to upstream 1.6.6
  - Note gifski 1.6.6 requires at least Rust 1.56 / Windows 7. On older
    systems we fall back on the previous gifski 1.4.3 version. This
    includes the old CRAN winbuilder used for R < 4.2.

1.4.3-1:
  - Add libgifski ucrt64 binary

1.4.3
  - Major update in gifski rust library. This also required different
    threading implementation in the bindings.

0.8.7.1
  - Add workaround for compiling with old rustc compilers
  - Add workaround for linking error with experimental UCRT toolchain

0.8.7
  - CRAN insists that we override the standard cargo/rust behaviour which
    stores registry and crate data in ~/.cargo, because policy. So we now
    build with CARGO_HOME set to a temporary dir that is deleted afterwards.
    This probably makes this slower and more error prone, but I don't make
    these rules.

0.8.6
  - Update gifski crate to 0.8.6
  - save_gif() now properly closes graphics device when expr errors
  - More rubust C code to prevent segfaults on write errors
  - File paths are now converted to UTF-8 as described in gifski.h
